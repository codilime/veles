# Disabled checks:
# - cert-err58-cpp:
#     We use many QString globals which theoretically can throw in constructors
#     (and we're fine with that).
# - misc-misplaced-widening-cast:
#     Too many warnings when using Qt (e.g. in
#     `static_cast<Qt::ItemDataRole>(Qt::UserRole + 1)` ).
# - modernize-use-equals-default:
#     Doesn't work well with our Variant-like union in msgpackobject.h.
# - modernize-raw-string-literal
#     Proposes changes even for short and trivial strings, e.g. "asd\\asd" (raw
#     string literals have long and ugly syntax, not worth to use in such
#     places).
# - modernize-use-equals-delete
#     Doesn't work with GTest's TEST() macro.
# - modernize-use-default-member-init
#     Sometimes it is more readable to set some members in a constructor.
# - modernize-use-emplace
#     Warns also about push_back(SomeFactory::create()).
# - readability-braces-around-statements:
#     There are parts of the code where short `if(A) B;` is preferred.
# - misc-suspicious-enum-usage:
#     Incompatible with Qt (e.g. QKeySequence(Qt::CTRL | Qt::Key_G)).
